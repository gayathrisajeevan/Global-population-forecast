# Forecasting Global Demographics: Time Series Analysis of Population Growth

## Overview
This project focuses on the **time series analysis** of global population growth using statistical models. It examines historical population data and applies forecasting techniques to predict future trends.

## Methodology
- **Data Sources**: Population data from 1950 to 2022 for four countries (India, China, Russia, and the USA).  
- **Models Used**:
  - Autoregressive (AR)
  - Moving Average (MA)
  - Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
  - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- **Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to determine the best model for forecasting.

## Key Findings
- **ARIMA model** was the most effective for population forecasting.
- India's population is expected to **increase**, while China and Russia may see a **decline** by 2025.
- Demographic factors influencing trends include economic conditions, government policies, birth rates, and mortality rates.

## Technologies Used
- **Python / R** for statistical analysis and model implementation.
- **Power BI** for visualization.

## Future Scope
- Expanding the dataset to include more countries.
- Exploring machine learning models for improved forecasting accuracy.
